This section of repositary contains the algorithms like Linear Search and Binary Search. 
Also I have added two more codes for reversing an array.
The first one uses an extra space, it creates a copy array and then reverses the original array.
Another method is the one without the use of an extra space. 
Here with the help of range of array it is reversed.
